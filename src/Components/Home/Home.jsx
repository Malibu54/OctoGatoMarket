      <h1> Mascot </h1>
      <p>
        GitHub's mascot is an anthropomorphized "octocat" with five octopus-like
        arms. 
        <br/>
        The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip
        art to sell on iStock, a website that enables designers to market
        royalty-free digital images. 
        <br/>
        GitHub became interested in Oxley's work
        after Twitter selected a bird that he designed for their own logo.
        The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named
        Octopuss. 
        <br/>
        Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that
        the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy
        exclusive rights to the image. 
        <br/>
        GitHub renamed Octopuss to
        Octocat, and trademarked the character along with the new
        name.Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for
        different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and
        various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the
        character, which are available on The Octodex
